# Cyberdeck-Build
Project files for ongoing cyberdeck build

The KeyboardInsert.stl needs to be glued to the KeyboardTopPlate.stl from underneath. 

The LattePanda Delta 3 will be attached to the Midplate.stl using four prints of the Standoff.stl, four 12mm M3 bolts, and four M3 nuts. Two of those nuts are set into the print of Midplate.Stl. What you want to do in when your slicing is pause the print right before the holes for the nuts are covered. Once your print is paused, drop the two nuts in the open hole. When the print resumes, it will encase the nuts in the print created threaded holes. The Delta 3 will be place on the convex side of the Midplate.stl print with the fan facing away from the print. The screen will sit in the concave side of Midplat.stl. 

The only construction for the Backplate.stl will be to add the Switch.stl and SwitchCover.stl into a small slot on the top left side of the Backplate. If you look at Switch.stl you will see what looks kind of like a small bow and arrow. Place the switch in the slot as if the little arrow is shooting out of the Backplate. The SwitchCover will slide down on top of that. The shape of the Switch acts as a spring that will allow you to turn on the Delta 3 once all together.
