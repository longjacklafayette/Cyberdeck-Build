1. Lattepanda Delta 3
    - Here is the offical webiste for the Delta 3 but I would suggest checking on ebay or other reseller sites for this device. Brand new and from Lattepanda it is a little pricey.

2. Lattepand 7" edp touchscreen
    - They make two differnt 7" edp touchsccreen and one claims not to be compatible with the Delta 3, so if you're buying this from a reseller, keep that in mind.

3. Iniu Power Bank
    - I used the 20,000mAh bank (and that is what is linked below) however, they do make a 25,000mAh version that looks really similiar but could be a different physical size.

5. External Battery Bank Switch
    - I purchased several of these off of amazon that claimed to handle PD power but in practice they did not. I purchased the linked one below and it worked great. Just keep that in mind.

6. Pack of bolts and nuts I know will fit the files. 
    - I would assumes most M3 nuts and bolts in the sizes I mentiioned will work but these are the ones I used and modeled to make the device.

9. I am also booting from an nvme drive which made the device much faster. It does come with some onboard storage so it is optional.
